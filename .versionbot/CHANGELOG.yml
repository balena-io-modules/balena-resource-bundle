    - subject: Fix Node.js runtime exiting when manifest size is too big
      hash: 79b414e129eeed35a6eb5ed9a0bf252e0f46be8b
      body: >
        When reading a resource bundle with big manifest file, we did not attach

        immediately the tar entry stream for contents.json, but instead iterated

        next to the contents.sig tar entry. For bigger contents.json files that

        would drain only the start of the contents.json file, but not the rest
        of

        it, which in turn caused the Node.js runtime to exit immediately with

        exit status 13.


        Now we properly order iterating and reading the contents of the
        contents.json

        and contents.sig files.

    - subject: Increase Hasher maximum allowed listeners
      hash: 39c3f038617c0e6aa44ef0c511387b784341d53b
      body: >
        The streams pipeline API attaches a lot of listeners and that may
        trigger

        a false warning about possible memory leak, so we increase the maximum

        allowed listeners count to silence it. 100 is a reasonable number.
